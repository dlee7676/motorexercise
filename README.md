motorexercise
=============

This is my solution to the sensor/motor programming exercise.  It implements the sensor, motor, and door latch, and uses the implemented methods to display the distance the motor would move with the given sample data.

The program can be compiled on the command line with g++, for example:

g++ CLatch.cpp CMotor.cpp CSensor.cpp main.cpp

It can then be run from the generated executable.
